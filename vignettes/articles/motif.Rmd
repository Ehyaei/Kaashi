```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.align = "center",
  fig.width = 5
)
```

```{r setup}
library(Kaashi)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
```

The goal of motif function is to produce a polygon or polyline pattern for each tile shape.
In Hankin's method, two rays grow from a pair of points equidistant from the edge’s midpoint. 
To generate Islamic patterns, we employ the Hankin method. Shapes are made from the intersection of these rays.

As mentioned before to generation motifs we need:

- polygon
- midpoint of one side
- $\theta$, the angle of rays respect polygon edge between 0 to 90
- $\delta$, the distance of rays source points from the edge’s midpoint between -0.5 to 0.5
- n, number of polygon edges

The function `regularPolygon` is useful to create regular polygon vertices. 
This function produces a regular polygon with sides of length one such that its first side is on the x-axis (fro (-1,0) to (1,0)).
In this case the origin is polygon side's midpoint. In the default setting `regularPolygon` is matrix of that each row is vertex

```{r}
hexagonal = regularPolygon(6)
hexagonal %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = V1, y  = V2))+
  geom_polygon(fill = "transparent",color = "black")+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw() + labs(x = "X", y = "Y")+
  coord_fixed()
```

If set `sf = TRUE` in `regularPolygon`, the output is sf class object and has area and name columns.
This option is good for cases where you want to combine simple polygons to make a motif.

```{r}
hexpoly = regularPolygon(6,sf = T)
tilePlotter(hexpoly)
```

To create motifs, we need set $\theta$ and $\delta$.

```{r}
tile <- motif(hexagonal,n = 6,theta = 45, delta = 0.5,polyLine = T, drawBox = T)
tilePlotter(tile)
```

If set `polyLine = T` the output object is sf calss of polygons with name and area columns.

```{r}
square = regularPolygon(4)
tile <- motif(square,n = 4,theta = 45, delta = 0.3, polyLine = F)
head(tile)
tilePlotter(tile)
```

As it can be seen tile tile object includes `r length(unique(tile$name))` regions and
`r length(unique(tile$area))` different area. 

```{r}
pal <- colorRampPalette(c("#FFAD00","#002D7B","#007EA1"))
tileColors = pal(length(unique(tile$name)))
tilePlotter(tile, fill = "name",tileColor = tileColors)+
  geom_sf_label(aes(label = name),color = "black")

tileColors = tileColors = pal(length(unique(tile$area)))
tilePlotter(tile, fill = "area",tileColor = tileColors)+
  geom_sf_label(aes(label = area),color = "black")
```

To modify distance between polygons in `motif` use `dist` option.

```{r}
tile <- motif(square,n = 4,theta = 45, delta = 0.3, polyLine = F,dist = 0.1)
tilePlotter(tile)
```

## Combination of Motifs

It is possible to combine motifs through transfer and rotation.
In this way, we can use semi-regular or Archimedean tilings.
The following is an example of this type.

```{r}
oc = regularPolygon(8)
sq = regularPolygon(4)
octagonal = motif(box = oc, theta = 45, delta = 0.5, n = 8, polyLine = F)
square = motif(box = sq, theta = 45, delta = 0.5, n = 4, polyLine = F)
s1 = square %>% mutate(geometry = geometry + (oc[3,]-sq[1,]))
s2 = square %>% mutate(geometry = geometry + (oc[6,]-sq[1,]))
tile = rbind(octagonal,s1,s2)
tilePlotter(tile)
```
